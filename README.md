# 3d-Gaussian-Splatting-Project
The objective of this project is to implement a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to reconstruct realistic 3D scenes from multiple 2D images. The project aims to explore how Gaussian splats can be used as an efficient alternative to traditional neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for real-time, photorealistic scene rendering.

##Dataset
The Lego Robot dataset is created by us for this project specifically. The reason behind this dataset was the memory constraints of Google Colab, which is the platform we used for this project. The dataset consists of 50 images of the lego version of the robot Wall-E from different angles. The object is centered in front of a white background to make things easier for feature extraction. It can be seen under 3dgs_lego_dataset

##Contribution and Final Report
This project was done in a group of 2. Our final report is also attached in the repository. In terms of contribution, our pipeline included four parts, and my parter and I evenly split each step in the pipeline, and documented our findings in the attached final report. 

##Code
The code was written on Google Colab, and the notebook is linked in the repository
